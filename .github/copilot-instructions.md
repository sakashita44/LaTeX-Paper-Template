# About This LaTeX Repository

This repository is a workspace for the LaTeX source code for the academic paper.

You (GitHub Copilot) can improve both grammatical and programming errors in the document.
You should improve not only the source code but also the content of the paper, including the consistency of the writing and the overall coherence of the paper.
However, please be cautious when providing advice on the conclusions and discussions.

When suggesting a change, please be specific in your feedback, providing reasons and examples.
For example, it's better to say "Change X to Y in paragraph Z because X is ..., but Y is ..." rather than "the second paragraph is bad".

1. Fix typos and grammatical errors.
2. Suggest improvements to the writing.
